This distribution contains two modules Filesys::Statvfs
and Filesys::Df.

DESCRIPTION
Filesys::Statvfs provides an interface between
Perl and the statvfs() system call.

Filesys::Df uses Filesys::Statvfs to obtain
filesystem statistics and then uses them to 
create additional filesystem information such as
percent full, user and superuser differentials, etc.
You can also specify the block size for the values you
wish to see.

SYNOPSIS Filesys::Statvfs

use Filesys::Statvfs;

	my($bsize, $frsize, $blocks, $bfree, $bavail,
        $files, $ffree, $favail, $fsid, $basetype, $flag,
        $namemax, $fstr)=statvfs("/tmp");


SYNOPSIS Filesys::Df

use Filesys::Df;

	my $ref=df("/tmp", 1024);  #1024 block size output
	print"Percent Full: $ref->{per}\n";
	print"Total Blocks: $ref->{blocks}\n";
	print"Blocks Available: $ref->{bavail}\n";
	print"Blocks Used: $ref->{used}\n";
	print"Inode Percent full: $ref->{fper}\n";
	print"Inodes Free: $ref->{favail}\n";
	print"Inodes Used: $ref->{fused}\n";

	#These are just some of the keys that are available.
	#See the documentation for the others.



INSTALL
TO INSTALL RUN:
	
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

For this module to install and work you will need
to have statvfs() on your system. A good way to tell if
you have it is to look for the sys/statvfs.h header
in your include directory. (Usually /usr/include/)

If there is an error during the 'make', it is
possible that you do not have statvfs() on your system.
Another possible reason may be that the statvfs structure defined
in statvfs.h does not contain one or more of the fields that are
defined in Statvfs.xs.

During the 'make test' test.pl will use statvfs()
to stat the root directory "/". If it fails it will
report an error, otherwise it will report all the 
standard fields in the statvfs structure. If you
are running any kind of Digital Unix the fstr value
may be NULL. The 'make test' will then proceed to test df().

Once installed, run 'perldoc Filesys::Statvfs' and
'perldoc Filesys::Df' for more information. 

In the future I plan on having support for statfs().
I also plan on having all of the fields available for statvfs() depending
on the OS type. For instance HP-UX 10x has two extra non standard
fields in their statvfs structure. 

This has been tested successfully on HP-UX 10x, IRIX 6.3,
Solaris 2.6, and some Digital Unix.

If you have any problems or questions please email
me at IGuthrie@aol.com with "Filesys Module" in
the subject line.
