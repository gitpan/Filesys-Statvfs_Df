This distribution contains two modules Filesys::Statvfs
and Filesys::Df.

Filesys::Statvfs provides an interface between
Perl and the statvfs() system call.

Filesys::Df uses Filesys::Statvfs to obtain
filesystem statistics and then uses them to 
create additional filesystem information
such as percent full, etc. You can also specify the
block size for the values you wish to see.

TO INSTALL RUN:
	
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

For this module to install and work you will need
to have statvfs() on your system. A good way to tell if
you have it is to look for the sys/statvfs.h header
in your include directory. (Usually /usr/include/)

If there is an error during the 'make', it is
possible that you do not have statvfs() on your system.
Another possible reason may be that the statvfs structure defined
in statvfs.h does not contain one or more of the fields that are
defined in Statvfs.xs.

During the 'make test' test.pl will use statvfs()
to stat the root directory "/". If it fails it will
report an error, otherwise it will report all the 
standard fields in the statvfs structure. If you
are running any kind of Digital Unix the fstr value
may be NULL. The 'make test' will then proceed to test df().

In the future I plan on having support for statfs()
and to have all fields available for statvfs() depending
on the OS type. For instance HP-UX  10x has two extra non standard
fields in their statvfs structure. 

Once installed, run 'perldoc Filesys::Statvfs' and
'perldoc Filesys::Df' for more information. 

This has been tested successfully on HP-UX 10x, IRIX 6.3,
Solaris 2.6, and some Digital Unix.

If you have any problems or questions please email
me at IGuthrie@aol.com with "Filesys Module" in
the subject line.
