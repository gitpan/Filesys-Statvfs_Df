0.55 Sun Nov 28 1999
	- Added support for Linux

0.61 Fri Jan 7 2000 
	- I added support for AIX. 
        - Fixed a bug where the statvfs data
          would be out of order when I started 
          ifdefing stuff out of Statvfs.xs.
	  This would only occur to less used members
	  of the statvfs struct like fsid. 
	  The actual block and inode counts where
	  unaffected so you would still get an
	  accurate picture of the space on the
	  filesystem. I fixed this by returning
	  0 for integers and NULL for strings
	  that are not used by the statvfs 
	  structure.

0.65 Wed Nov 22 2000 
        - Assumed that for NFS filesystems the inode value would be -1.
          Looks like RH 6.2 returns 0 instead. Fixed problem that would
          cause the module to abort on NFS filesystems for RH.

0.67 Fri Nov 24 2000 
	- Fixed some documentation errors. No code changes.

0.68 Wed Jun 26 2002
	- If the blocks field was zero a divde by 0 error would occur.
	  This would occur if a filesystem such as /proc was stated.
	  Df() now returns undef when this occurs.
